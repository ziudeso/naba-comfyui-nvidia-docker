<h1>ComfyUI (NVIDIA) Docker</h1>

[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/tree/master) is a Stable Diffusion WebUI. 
With the recent addition of a [Flux example](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/flux/), I created this container builder to test it.

The container size (over 5GB) contains the required components on an Ubuntu 22.04 image with Nvidia CUDA and CuDNN (the base container is available from Nvidia's DockerHub); we add the requirements components to support an installation of ComfyUI.

During its first run, it will download ComfyUI from git (into the `run/ComfyUI` folder), create a Python virtual environment (in `run/venv`) for all the Python packages needed by the tool, and install [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) into ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` directory. 
This adds an expected 5GB of content to the installation. Depending on your internet connection, it takes as much time as necessary to complete.  
You will know the ComfyUI WebUI is running when you check the `docker logs` and see `To see the GUI go to: http://0.0.0.0:8188`

**About 10GB of space between the container and the virtual environment installation is needed.**
This does not consider the models, additional package installations, or custom nodes that the end user might perform.

**ComfyUI's `security_levels` are not accessible until the configuration file is created during the first run.**

It is recommended that a container monitoring tool be available to watch the logs and see when installations are completed or other relevant messages. Some installations and updates (updating packages, downloading content, etc.) will take a long time, and the lack of updates on the WebUI is not a sign of failure.
[Dozzle](https://github.com/amir20/dozzle) is a good solution for following the logs from a WebUI.

# 1. Preamble

This build is made to NOT run as the `root` user, but run within the container as a `comfy` user using the UID/GID requested at `docker run` time (if none are provided, the container will use 1024/1024).
This is done to allow end users to have local directory structures for all the side data (input, output, temp, user), Hugging Face `HF_HOME` if used, and the entire `models`, which are separate from the container and able to be altered by the user.
To request a different UID/GID at run time, use the `WANTED_UID` and `WANTED_GID` environment variables when calling the container.

# 2. Running the container

In the directory where we intend to run the container, create the `run` folder as the user with whom we want to share the UID/GID. **This needs to be done before the container is run (it is started as root, so the folder, if it does not exist, will be created as root)** (or give it another name; adapt the `-v` mapping in the `docker run` below). 

That `run` folder will be populated with a few sub-directories created with the UID/GID passed on the command line (see the command line below). 
Among the folders that will be created within `run` are `HF, ComfyUI, venv`
- `HF` is the expected location of the `HF_HOME` (HuggingFace installation directory)
- `ComfyUI` is the git clone version of the tool, with all its sub-directories, among which:
  - `custom_nodes` for additional support nodes, for example ComfyUI-Manager,
  - `models` and all its sub-directories is where `checkpoints`, `clip`, `loras`, `unet`, etc have to be placed.
  - `input` and `output` are where input images will be placed and generated images will end up. 
- `venv` is the virtual environment where all the required Python packages for ComfyUI and other additions will be placed. A default ComfyUI package installation requires about 5GB of additional installation in addition to the container itself; those packages will be in this `venv` folder.

When starting t the container image executes the `init.bash` script that performs a few operations:
- Ensure we can use the `WANTED_UID` and `WANTED_GID` as the `comfy` user (the user set to run the container),
- Obtain the latest version of ComfyUI from GitHub if not already present in the mounted `run` folder.
- Create the virtual environment (`venv`)  if it does not already exist
- Activate this virtual environment
- Install all the ComfyUI-required Python packages. If those are already present, additional content should not need to be downloaded.
- Installing ComfyUI-Manager if it is not present.
  - During additional runs, we will allow the user to change the `security_level` from `normal` to another value set using the `SECURITY_LEVEL` environment passed to the container (see the "Security Levels" section of this document for details) to allow for the tool grant more of less functionalities
- Check for a user custom script in the "run" directory. It must be named `user_script.bash`. If one exists, run it.
- Run the ComfyUI WebUI. For the exact command run, please see the last line of `init.bash`


## 2.1. docker run

To run the container on an NVIDIA GPU, mount the specified directory, expose the port 8188 (change this by altering the `-p local:container` port mapping), pass the calling user's UID and GID to the container, and select the `SECURITY_LEVEL`:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --runtime nvidia --gpus all -v `pwd`/run:/comfy/mnt -e WANTED_UID=`id -u` -e WANTED_GID=`id -g` -e SECURITY_LEVEL=normal -p 8188:8188 --name comfyui-nvidia mmartial/comfyui-nvidia-docker:latest
```

## 2.2. Docker compose

In the directory where you want to run the compose stack, create the `compose.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  comfyui-nvidia:
    image: mmartial/comfyui-nvidia-docker:latest
    container_name: comfyui-nvidia
    ports:
      - 8188:8188
    volumes:
      - ./run:/comfy/mnt
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - WANTED_UID=1000
      - WANTED_GID=1000
      - SECURITY_LEVEL=normal
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
      - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities:
                - gpu
                - compute
                - utility
```

This will expose on port 8188 (`host:container`), use a `run` directory local to the directory where this `compose.yml`  is, and specify the `WANTED_UID` and `WANTED_GID` to 1000 (adapt as needed). Make sure to create the `run` directory as the user with the wanted uid and gid before running the docker compose for the first time.

Start it with `docker compose up` (with `-detached` to run the container in the background)

Please see [docker compose up](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/) reference manual for additional details.

For users interested in adding it to a [Dockge](https://dockge.kuma.pet/) (a self-hosted Docker Compose stacks management tool ) stack,  please see my [Dockge blog post](https://blg.gkr.one/20240706-dockge/) where we discuss directory and bind mounts (models take a lot of space).

## 2.3. First time use

The first time we run the container, we will go to our host's IP on port 8188 (likely `http://127.0.0.1:8188`) and see the latest run or the bottle-generating example.


Before attempting to run this example, restarting the container is recommended.
The default security model of `normal` is used unless specified, but the needed configuration file is created at the first run of the container. As such, the ComfyUI Manager's default `security_level` can not be modified until the first container restart (after the WebUI ran the first time).

This example requires the [`v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/resolve/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt) file which can be downloaded directly from the `Manager`'s "Model Manager".

It is also possible to manually install Stable Diffusion checkpoints, upscale, or Loras (and more) by placing them directly in their respective directories under the `models` folder. For example to manually install the require "bottle example" checkpoint, as the user with the wanted uid/gid:

```bash
cd <YOUR_RUN_DIRECTORY>/ComfyUI/models/checkpoints
wget https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/resolve/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt
```

After the download is complete, click "Refresh" on the WebUI and "Queue Prompt"

Depending on the workflow, some "cutom nodes" might be needed. Those should usually be available in the "Manager"'s "Install Missing Custom Nodes".
Other needed files could be found on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) or [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/).

"Custom nodes" should be installed using the "Manager" unless as the ability to manually install those is dependent on the `security_levels` selected.

# 3. Docker image

## 3.1. Building the image

Note that a `docker buildx prune -f` might be needed to force a clean build after removing already existing containers.

The `comfyui-nvidia-docker` (`latest`) image contains the installation of the core components of ComfyUI from its latest release from GitHub. 

Running `make` will show us the different build options; `latest` is the one we want.

Run:
```bash
make latest
```

## 3.2. Availability on DockerHub

Builds are available on DockerHub at [mmartial/comfyui-nvidia-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmartial/comfyui-nvidia-docker), built from this repository's `Dockerfile`.

## 3.3. Unraid availability

The container has been tested on Unraid and [added to Community Apps an 2024-09-02](assets/Unraid_CA-ComfyUI-Nvidia-Docker.png).

# 5. FAQ

## 5.1. Virtualenv

The container pip installs all required packages in the container and then creates a virtual environment (in `/comfy/mnt/venv` with `comfy/mnt` mounted with the `docker run [...]—v`). 

This allows for the installation of Python packages using `pip3 install`. 

After running `docker exec -t comfy-nvidia /bin/bash` from the provided `bash`, activate the `venv` with `source /comfy/mnt/venv/bin/activate`.
From this `bash` prompt, you can now run `pip3 freeze` or other `pip3` commands such as `pip3 install civitai`

## 5.2. user_script.bash

The `run/user_script.bash` user script can perform additional operations. 
Because this is a Docker container, updating the container will remove any additional installations that are not in the "run" directory, so it is possible to force some reinstall at runtime.
It is also possible to bypass the ComfyUI command started (for people interested in trying the `--fast` for example).

To perform those changes, be aware that:
- The container image is Ubuntu based.
- The `comfy` user is `sudo` capable.

A simple example of one could be:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "== Adding system package"
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sudo apt update
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sudo apt install -y nvtop

echo "== Adding python package"
source /comfy/mnt/venv/bin/activate
pip3 install pipx
echo "== Adding nvitop"
# nvitop will be installed in the user's .local/bin directory which will be removed when the container is updated
pipx install nvitop
# extend the path to include the installation directory
export PATH=/comfy/.local/bin:${PATH}
# when starting a new docker exec, will still need to be run as ~/.local/bin/nvitop
# but will be in the PATH for commands run from within this script

echo "== Override ComfyUI launch command"
# Make sure to have activated the venv before running this command 
cd /comfy/mnt/ComfyUI
python3 ./main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --disable-auto-launch --fast

echo "== To prevent the regular Comfy command from starting, we 'exit 1'"
echo "   If we had not overrode it, we could simply end with an ok exit: 'exit 0'" 
exit 1
```

The script will be placed in the `run` directory, and must be named `user_script.bash` to be found.

If you encounter an error, it is recommended to check the container logs; this script must be executable and readable by the `comfy` user.
If the file is not executable, the tool will attempt to make it executable, but if the file is owned by another user, the step will fail.

## 5.3. Available environment variables

### 5.3.1. WANTED_UID and WANTED_GID

The Linux User ID (`uid`) and Group ID (`gid`) will be used by the `comfy` user within the container.
It is recommended that those be set to the end-user's `uid` and `gid` to allow the addition of files, models, and other content within the `run` directory.
For content to be added within the `run` directory, it must be created with those `uid` and `gid`.

The running user's `uid` and `gid` can be obtained using `id -u` and `id -g` in a terminal.

### 5.3.2. COMFY_CMDLINE_BASE and COMFY_CMDLINE_XTRA

You can add extra parameters by adding ComfyUI-compatible command-line arguments to the `COMFY_CMDLINE_XTRA` environment variable.
For example: `docker run [...] -e COMFY_CMDLINE_XTRA="--fast --reserve-vram 2.0 --lowvram"`

The default command line used by the script to start ComfyUI is `python3 ./main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --disable-auto-launch`
This is also the default value set to the `COMFY_CMDLINE_BASE` variable during the initialization script. **It is recommended not to alter the value of this variable, as this might prevent the tool from starting successfully**.

The tool will run the combination of COMFY_CMDLINE_BASE followed by COMFY_CMDLINE_XTRA. In the above example:
```bash
python3 ./main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --disable-auto-launch --fast --reserve-vram 2.0 --lowvram
```

In case of container failure, checking the container logs for error messages is recommended.

The tool does not attempt to resolve quotes or special shell characters, so it is recommended that you prefer the `user_script.bash` method.

It is also possible to use the environment variables in combination with the `users_script.bash` by 1) not starting ComfyUI from the script and 2) exiting with `exit 0` (i.e., success), which will allow the rest of the script to continue. The following example installs additional Ubuntu packages and allows for the environment variables to be used:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#echo "== Adding system package"
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sudo apt-get update
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sudo apt-get install -y libgl1 libglib2.0-0

# Exit with an "okay" status to allow the init script to run the regular ComfyUI command
exit 0
```

Note that `pip install`ation of custom nodes is not possible in `normal` security level, and `weak` should be used instead (see the "Security levels" section for details)

### SECURITY_LEVEL

After initial run, it is possible to use the `SECURITY_LEVEL` environment variable to alter the default security level imposed by ComfyUI Manager.

When following the rules defined at https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager?tab=readme-ov-file#security-policy the user should decide if `normal` will work for their use case. 
If you manually install or alter custom nodes, you will prefer `weak`.
**WARNING: Using `normal-` will prevent access to the WebUI.**

## 5.4. ComfyUI Manager & Security levels

[ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/) is installed and available in the container.

The container is accessible on `0.0.0.0` internally to the container (ie all network interfaces), but is only accessible on the exposed port outside of the running container.

To modify the `security_level`:
- manually: by going into your "run" folder directory and editing either `ComfyUI/user/default/ComfyUI-Manager/config.ini` if present, otherwise `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/config.ini` and alter the `security_level = ` to match your requirements (then reload ComfyUI)
- automatically: use the `SECURITY_LEVEL` docker environment variable at run time to set it for this run.

Note that if this is the first time starting the container, the file will not yet exist; it is created the first time ComfyUI is run. After this step, stop and restart the container; the `config.ini` will be there at consecutive restarts

To use `cm-cli`, from the virtualenv, use: `python3 /comfy/mnt/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/cm-cli.py`.
For example: `python3 /comfy/mnt/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/cm-cli.py show installed` (`COMFYUI_PATH=/ComfyUI` should be set)

## 5.5. Additional FAQ

See [extras/FAQ.md] for additional FAQ topics, among which:
- Updating ComfyUI
- Updating ComfyUI-Manager
- Installing a custom node from git

# 6. Troubleshooting

The `venv` in the "run" directory contains all the required Python packages used by the tool.
In case of an issue, it is recommended that you terminate the container, delete the `venv` directory, and restart the container. 
The virtual environment will be recreated; any `custom_scripts` should re-install their requirements.
